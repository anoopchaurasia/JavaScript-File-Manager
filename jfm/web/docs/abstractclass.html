            <!-- Abstract Methods and Classes -->
            <p>An <i>abstract class</i> is a class that is declared <code>AbstractClass</code>—it may or may not include abstract methods. 
                Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.</p>
            <p>An <i>abstract method</i> is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), 
                like this:</p>
            <div class="codeblock"><pre>Abstract.moveTo = function(){};
                </pre></div>
            <p>If a class includes abstract methods, the class itself <i>must</i> be declared <code>abstract</code>, as in:</p>
            <div class="codeblock"><pre>
    AbstractClass("GraphicObject");
    GraphicObject {
   // declare fields
   // declare non-abstract methods
   Abstract.draw= function(){};
}
                </pre></div>
            <p>When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent
                class. However, if it does not, the subclass must also be declared <code>abstract</code>.</p>
            <div class="note"><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;All of the methods in an <i>interface</i> (see the   section) are
                <i>implicitly</i> abstract, so the <code>abstract</code> modifier is not used with interface methods (it could be—it's just
                not necessary).
                In the section on Interfaces, it was noted that a class that implements an interface must implement all of the interface's methods. It is possible, however, to define a class that does not implement all of the interface methods, provided that the class is declared to be abstract.
