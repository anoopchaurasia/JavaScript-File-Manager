            <h2>Interfaces</h2>
            <p>An <i>interface</i> is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain <i>only</i> 
                constants, method signatures, and nested types. 
                There are no method bodies. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be <i>implemented</i> 
                by classes or <i>extended</i> by other interfaces. Extension is discussed later in this 
                lesson.
            </p>
            <p>Defining an interface is similar to creating a new class:</p>
            <div class="codeblock"><pre>
                fm.Interface("OperateCar");
                    OperateCar = function() {

                    // constant declarations, if any
                        this.staticconst = 23;
                    // method signatures

                    this.turn = function(){};   
                    // more method signatures
                };
             </pre></div> 
        </div>
        
        For Front-End development, The biggest problem I faced is to manage JavaScript as code size increases. So I started developing a framework which can manage JS files. 

Here I am sharing this framework which can help to create a Java like class.

How to read documentation:

    Unzip JFM.zip.
    Open index.html in browser.
